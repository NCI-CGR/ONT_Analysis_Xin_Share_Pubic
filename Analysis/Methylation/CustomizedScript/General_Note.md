**Description of bedMethyl output**

Below is a description of the bedMethyl columns generated by `modkit pileup`. A brief description of the
bedMethyl specification can be found on [Encode](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/wgbs/).

### Definitions:

* N<sub>mod</sub> - Number of calls passing filters that were classified as a residue with a specified base modification.
* N<sub>canonical</sub> - Number of calls passing filters were classified as the canonical base rather than modified. The
exact base must be inferred by the modification code. For example, if the modification code is `m` (5mC) then
the canonical base is cytosine. If the modification code is `a`, the canonical base is adenosine.
* N<sub>other mod</sub> - Number of calls passing filters that were classified as modified, but where the modification is different from the listed base (and the corresponding canonical base is equal). For example, for a given cytosine there may be 3 reads with
`h` calls, 1 with a canonical call, and 2 with `m` calls. In the bedMethyl row for `h` N<sub>other_mod</sub> would be 2. In the
`m` row N<sub>other_mod</sub> would be 3.
* N<sub>valid_cov</sub> - the valid coverage. N<sub>valid_cov</sub> = N<sub>mod</sub> + N<sub>other_mod</sub> + N<sub>canonical</sub>, also used as the `score` in the bedMethyl
* N<sub>diff</sub> - Number of reads with a base other than the canonical base for this modification. For example, in a row
for `h` the canonical base is cytosine, if there are 2 reads with C->A substitutions, N<sub>diff</sub> will be 2.
* N<sub>delete</sub> - Number of reads with a deletion at this reference position
* N<sub>fail</sub> - Number of calls where the probability of the call was below the threshold. The threshold can be
set on the command line or computed from the data (usually failing the lowest 10th percentile of calls).
* N<sub>nocall</sub> - Number of reads aligned to this reference position, with the correct canonical base, but without a base
modification call. This can happen, for example, if the model requires a CpG dinucleotide and the read has a
CG->CH substitution such that no modification call was produced by the basecaller.
