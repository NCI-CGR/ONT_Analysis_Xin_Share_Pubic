## DMR and DML analysis
### DSS
1. Introduction
```
DSS implements a series of DE/DM detection algorithms based on the dispersion shrinkage method
followed by Wald statistical test to test each gene/CpG site for differential expression/methylation.
It provides functions for RNA-seq DE analysis for both two group comparision and multi-factor design,
BS-seq DM analysis for two group comparision, multi-factor design, and data without biological replicate.
