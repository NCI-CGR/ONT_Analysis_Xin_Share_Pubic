## Dataset

1. The BAM files of WGS-scale
```
https://42basepairs.com/browse/s3/ont-open-data/giab_2025.01/basecalling/hac
```

2. the wf-human-variation outputs (including bedmethyl files) 
```
https://42basepairs.com/browse/s3/ont-open-data/giab_2025.01/analysis/wf-human-variation/hac
``` 

## Notice 
These are not ‘benchmarks’ in the sense that we know what the methylation status is, but these will serve to set expectations about quality control and result outputs and interpretations.
